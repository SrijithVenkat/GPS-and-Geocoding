When you have completed the step assignment, complete the following form and compute your assignment grade. Include this file as a text in the folder with your project when you turn it in. Enter the number of points you deserve for each grading category. You may enter partial points if you feel you have partially completed the category.

Total available points:  100
For each item, if there is a request for the file and line number, indicate that as well so the TA can verify the code.

#My android device stopped working, so I could only test it on the emulator. I tried my best with what I had. I think it should work fine however, the logic seems correct.
